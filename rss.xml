            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This is the best time to book a flight to 10 destinations around the world</h1><p>While many of us might think booking a flight early is the best bet to lower costs, sometimes the opposite can be true. To help make it easier, KAYAK analyzed flight searches from the US and Canada between November 1, 2014 and October 31, 2015, determining the change in cost for 10 luxury cities when booking from a period of one month to six months before departure.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6df494fb55ba79e3fe576e707fe9bb613cafdd05.jpg"></article>]]></description>
