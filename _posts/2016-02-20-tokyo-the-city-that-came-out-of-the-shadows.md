description: "One of Daido Moriyama's best-known images is of a stray dog he encountered on a street in Aomori in northern Japan. Taken in 1971, it has become a metaphor for his way of working, symbolising his relentless wanderings though the streets of Tokyo in search of the essence of the city - an essence that for him often lies in the overlooked and the everyday, the makeshift and the mundane."
