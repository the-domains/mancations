description: 'The Persians named Cappadocia "the land of beautiful horses" after its wild mountain ponies - and the striking landscape of deep canyons and strangely shaped rocks is perfect for an unusual horseback adventure. Ride Worldwide has an eight-day group trip that crosses plateaux, canters along valley floors and explores remote villages.'
